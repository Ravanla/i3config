### conky

The panel on the desktop is (conky)[https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki/Configs]

I was on the conky website and [zagortenay333's conky config](https://github.com/zagortenay333/conky_themes) found inspiration

### i3bar
The bar on the desktop is i3bar(i3status....)

I found inspiration on Greshake's [i3status-rust](https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust) and dracula_theme [dracula_theme ](https://draculatheme.com/).
